<p> Coffee is one of the world’s most beloved beverages, enjoyed for its rich flavor, energizing <br> effects, and comforting aroma. It’s good not only because it helps you stay alert, but also because it <br> contains antioxidants that support overall health. A cup of coffee can boost your mood, <br> improve focus, and even make daily routines feel a little more enjoyable.<br>

</p>

<p>
  
  There are many types of coffee, but the two main species grown for consumption are Arabica and Robusta.<br> 
  
  <em>Arabica</em> beans are considered higher quality and are known for their smooth, mild, and often slightly<br> sweet flavor. They grow at higher altitudes and tend to have more complex taste profiles. 

<p>Robusta, on the other hand, has a stronger, more bitter flavor with earthy notes. These beans contain<br> almost double the caffeine of Arabica, which makes them more intense and often used in espresso<br> blends for added strength and crema.</p>

<ul>Benefits of coffee include:
  <p>
  <li>Increased energy and alertness</li>
	<li>Improved mood and cognitive function</li>
	<li>Rich in antioxidants that help fight cell damage</li>
	<li>May support metabolism and fat burning</li>
	<li>Potential protection against certain diseases (such as Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes)</li>
	<li>Can enhance physical performance during exercise</li>
  </p>
</ul>
